## PROGRAM 4: Write a program to do different operaters on variables
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int a,b; 
a=60;
b=10;
printf("A = %d\n B = %d\n\n",a,b);
printf("A + B = %d (Addition operator)\n",a+b);
printf("A - B = %d (Subtraction operator)\n",a-b);
printf("A * B = %d (Multiplication operator)\n",a*b);
printf("A ( B = %d (Division operator)\n",a/b);
printf("A and B = %d (Remainder operator)\n",a%b);
return 0;
}
```
**Output: A = 60, B = 10 ---
A + B = 70 (Addition operator) ---
A - B = 50 (Subtraction operator) --- 
A * B = 600 (Multiplication  operator) ---
A / B = 6 (Division operator) ---
A % B = 0 (Remainder operator)**
